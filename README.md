## Current Functionality
- Displays a random photo of a dog on initial load
- Allows users to select a specific dog breed theyâ€™d like to see from a dropdown menu 
- Allows users to click a button in order to get a new photo.
- Overlays photo with text

## Future Functionality to Implement

- [ ] Increase test coverage
  - [ ] i.e., mock fetch
- [ ] Improve styling and make it more mobile-responsive
  - [ ] Make CSS more flexible to accommodate different image ratios so that text is always ontop of the image vs. flowing off the image when the image is too small
- [ ] Modularize code more into more composable files
- [ ] Implement more robust and resilient way of extracting breed of a photo from the url in order to approve aria-label text
- [ ] Add server-side rendering to make application more SEO-friendly and have better speed performance
